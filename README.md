## About

> **PANDA ‚Äì NEXT GENERATION E-COMMERCE PLATFORM**

üìö Together with the bookshop Librer√≠a Utop√≠a we are
currently working on our üõí Panda eCommerce Platform.

üöÄ **[Panda](https://github.com/pandainfo/community)** aims to provide a modern
next generation CRM, ERP and CMS with [ONIX] and [EANCOM] support
for selling, merchandising and searching books and digital media.

[ONIX]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONIX_for_Books "ONIX for Books on Wikipedia"
[EANCOM]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML/EDIFACT "XML/EDIFACT on Wikipedia"

üìë For full documentation visit the üìù [docs](docs) pages and our
üë• community [wiki](https://github.com/pandainfo/community/wiki).

üñß Panda integrates several components in one system.

üéÅ See [features](docs/features.md) for details.
